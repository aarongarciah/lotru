## init

Use the `init` command to initialize configuration and dependencies for your existing project.

The `init` command installs dependencies, adds a `theme.ts` file with all the CSS variables, and configures `lotru.config.json` file with your project settings.

```bash
npx lotru@latest init
```

You will be asked a few questions to configure `lotru.config.json`:

```txt
- What framework are you using?
- Would you like to use TypeScript?
- Is your source code located in a src directory?
```

## add

Use the add command to add components and dependencies to your project.

```bash
npx lotru@latest add [component]
```

If a component has dependencies, they will be installed automatically.

If you do not provide a component, you will be prompted to select one from a list.

```text
Which components would you like to add?
› Space to select. A to toggle all. Enter to submit.

◯  alert
◯  avatar
◯  badge
◯  button
◯  card
◯  checkbox
◯  dialog
```

If you want to add multiple components at once, you can separate them with a space:

```bash
npx lotru@latest add [component] [component]
```

Or use the `--all` flag to add all components:

```bash
npx lotru@latest add --all
```
