<Steps>

### Create a project

Create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### Add Pigment CSS

Components are styled using Pigment CSS and you need to install it in your project.

Follow the [Pigment CSS](https://github.com/mui/pigment-css?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation-1) installation instructions to get started.

### Initialize the CLI

Run the `lotru` init command to setup your project:

```bash
pnpm dlx lotru@latest init
```

### Configure lotru.config.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure.

```txt
- What framework are you using?
- Would you like to use TypeScript?
- Is your source code located in a src directory?
```

### Add your first component

You can now add components to your project:

```bash
npx lotru@latest add ui/button
```
