<Steps>

<Step>Create a project</Step>

Create a new React project using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

<Step>Edit `tsconfig.app.json` file</Step>

Add the following code to the `tsconfig.app.json` file to resolve paths:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

<Step>Add Pigment CSS</Step>

Components are styled using Pigment CSS and you need to install it in your project.

Follow the [Pigment CSS](https://github.com/mui/pigment-css?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation-1) installation instructions to get started.

<Step>Initialize the CLI</Step>

Run the `lotru` init command to setup your project:

```bash
pnpm dlx lotru@latest init
```

<Step>Configure `lotru.config.json`</Step>

You will be asked a few questions to configure.

```txt
- What framework are you using?
- Would you like to use TypeScript?
- Is your source code located in a src directory?
```

<Step>Add your first component</Step>

You can now add components to your project:

```bash
npx lotru@latest add ui/button
```

</Steps>
